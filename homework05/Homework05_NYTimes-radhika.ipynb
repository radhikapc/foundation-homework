We wrote about some of the perks that start-ups were offering to potential employees to convince them to join their companies, including free meals, haircuts and even iPads. Now, Hipster, a start-up in San Francisco that lets people post queries and answers to others in their geographic area using the Web and a mobile phone, is trying to attract fresh faces to its company with a particularly attention-getting offer -- $10,000 and a year's supply of beer. The company is also offering a bicycle, pair of oversized glasses, skinny jeans, a bowtie, mustache-grooming services and a pair of boots. The prize was designed to resonate with the company's name. The beer, of course, is PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon, for those who are not hip).\n"
