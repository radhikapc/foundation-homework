# Playing Around With Interesting Datasets #

This homework assignment gave me so much satisfaction, because students were allowed to pick up their own favourite dataset for analysis. Being a space enthusiast since childhood I went straight in search of avaiable NASA datasets online. Google did not disappoint me: It quickly gave away the NASA Laboratory facilities dataset from Data.gov: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/agency-data-on-user-facilities. I spent a lot of time on deciding to pick up what for the second dataset. Because India Inc. is soaked in Startup mania, I decided to dig deep into a dataset that I stumbled upon from angellist.Disclaimer: the dataset wasn't clean enough, lacked many important points; so I had to manipulate that to an extent. It's not a trustworthy dataset, therefore don't take the insights for granted. Datasets on startups are available online, which are only accessible only by paid subscription.

## An Insight Into NASA Laboratory Facilities ##

* NASA runs a total of 397 lab facilities, Nasa Intelsat runs 17, Department of Defence(DOD) runs 7 labs, Department of Energy runs 12 labs, Raytheon runs 5, and Orbital Sciences Corporation (osc) runs only one NASA lab facility.
* The highest number of labs are located in the state : Alabama
* The lowest number of labs are located in the state : Arizona
* The highest number of labs started during the period: 1960 - 69
* The number of facilities started during this period is : 152
* The agency that has the highest number of labs: NASA 2 (I guess it stands for NASA Glenn Research Facilities. I will confirm)
* During 2010- 2016 only two new lab facilities has been started. They are DYNAVAC THERMAL VACUUM CHAMBER
 and General Vibration Lab (GVL).
* Roslin HIcks handles the highest number of facilities. Under him there are 136 labs.
* Marshall Space Flight Center has the highest number of lab facilities. The number is again 136.
* There are 388 active NASA lab facilities in the US.
* There are 22 inactive lab facilities in the US.

## An Insigt Into Indian Startup  Ecosystem##

This was a total waste of my time, unfortunately !

Only one insight, which we all know: Bangalore has the highest number of startups :-)
Can't call it an insight ! This dataset wasn't clean and was lacking important information so nothing worth sharing.
