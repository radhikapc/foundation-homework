A note about your date_parser function -- it actually just runs dateuteil's parser.parse function -- the reason we made our custom data parsing function is to deal with dirty data (rather than passing the parser.parse function to our dataframe -- it would use that function by default). It seems like you didn't run into a lot of the dirty data because you were looking at a smaller selection of the data, so the parser.parse function worked just fine. Just something to consider for the future though! 

Don't forget to run all the cells when you submit! The last few cells were not run in the version of the notebook that you submitted.
