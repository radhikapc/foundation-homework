## Playing with Twitter APIs and Twython  ##

This is the repository where I push the code into from my successful experimentation with Twitter APIs and Twython.

### @LedeGalaxy Twitter Bot ###

This is my very first attempt to create a simple Twitter bot. This app pulls data from a database of Solar System and tweet the features of the planets randomly.
For the same purpose, I downloaded a CSV file from Github that contains the basic features of Solar System. The CSV file then has been imported into my database, labelled, andromedabot.
The IPYNB file contains the complete code for this project.

### @ActOnMagicBot Twitter Bot ###

This is a bot which I created for ActOnMagic Technologies, a startup owned by one of my ex-colleagues at Citrix. Here tweets are scraped from the status update of the ActonMagic Technologies facebook page. 
- Work is in progress

The link to the bot is https://twitter.com/LedeGalaxy

### Twitter Timeline Analysis ###

This is my attempt to analyze a Twitter timeline by using Twitter API and twython. For this purpose, I picked up two Startups, co-founded my ex-colleagues : ActOnMagic and DoSelect. ActOnMagic is an intellegent cloud analytic platform whereas DoSelect has built a solid hiring platform for developers. I hope this analysis would help both the companies get an insight into the dispersion of their twitter followers around the globe.
