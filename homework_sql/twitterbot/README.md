## @LedeGalaxy Twitter Bot ##

This is my very first attempt to create a simple Twitter bot. This app pulls data from a database of Solar System and tweet the features of the planets randomly.
For the same purpose, I downloaded a CSV file from Github that contains the basic features of Solar System. The CSV file then have been imported into my database, labelled, andromedabot.
The IPYNB file contains the complete code for this project.

The link to the bot is https://twitter.com/LedeGalaxy
